1
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,709
(Male narrator) Love is a drug.
A class-A drug.

2
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,130
MRI scans have shown

3
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,209
that the euphoric dopamine rush
experienced by lovers

4
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:58,177
lights up the same areas of the brain
as cocaine and morphine.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,388
This reaction can act
as a powerful painkiller,

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,978
and oxytocin,
known as the cuddle hormone,

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,602
can be strong enough
to blind us to a lover's flaws.

8
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,921
(Female narrator) The continued
release of the stress hormones

9
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,686
adrenaline and cortisol

10
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,235
can ensure that the newly-smitten
cannot eat, cannot sleep,

11
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:19,702
and cannot think about anything other
than the target of their affection.

12
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,180
(Man) Love can strike
anyone anywhere,

13
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,557
and often when they least expect it.

14
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,431
But, rather than doing
what comes naturally,

15
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,359
we and the way we lead our lives
in today's busy world

16
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,733
put barriers in the way.

17
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,074
Just because nature has given us
the basic tools and instincts,

18
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,160
It doesn't mean that
everyone is going to be great at it.

19
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,456
(Woman) The expectation that
we should instinctively know it all

20
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,660
can mean that we don't educate
ourselves about sex.

21
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:12,042
This increases the tendency
to dodge big relationship issues

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:16,004
such as safe sex, bad sex
and lack of sex.

23
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,045
Like most things in life,
to do something well,

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,630
you have to learn and practice.

25
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,057
And sex is no exception.

26
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,872
Anyone who has ever experienced

27
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,202
the groin-swelling, nipple-hardening
intensity of sexual chemistry,

28
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,287
knows that when lust hits hard

29
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:57,337
it overwhelms the mind as furiously
as it overpowers the body.

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,262
(Man) So why is sex
such a powerful drive?

31
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:07,302
Anthropologists, logically enough,
put it down to the need for procreation.

32
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,889
Sex is essential to the survival
of the human species,

33
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,064
so we're made to crave it.

34
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,231
However,
unlike our hairier ancestors,

35
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,562
it's not just about breeding.

36
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,481
Courtesy of contraception,

37
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,735
we are uniquely free
to explore the excitement of sex

38
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,781
for its own sake.

39
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,614
(Woman) The upsides of such
freedom are obvious.

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,990
We can get to know ourselves

41
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,785
by exploring different sides
of our sexuality with our partner

42
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,128
or indeed different partners.

43
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,752
We can experience
the heady highs of lust

44
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,923
and enjoy orgasms in myriad ways
without risking pregnancy

45
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,629
or even commitment.

46
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,637
(Man) Great sex means different things
to different people.

47
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:55,016
Libidos vary, fantasies vary
and motivations vary.

48
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,769
Age, upbringing, health
and personal circumstances

49
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,947
can all have an effect
on people's desires.

50
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:06,778
And an individual's preferences
can change from day to day, too.

51
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,664
On some occasions, tender kisses
and slow sensual caresses

52
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,542
might bring passion to the fore.

53
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,165
(Woman) Sex can be about lust or love,

54
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,414
temptation or celebration,

55
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,839
affection or simply occupying
yourselves on a rainy Sunday.

56
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:29,016
No one motivation
will guarantee great sex,

57
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,603
but it's certainly worth exploring
all the options.

58
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,605
It's those people
who feel comfortable

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,275
enjoying, understanding
and exploring sex

60
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,899
that tend to have the most fun
with their clothes off.

61
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,527
(Man) Being honest
about your own cravings

62
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,406
and willing to explore
every inch of your lover's body

63
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,033
in a bid to learn
what really turns them on

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,374
is an essential part of great sex.

65
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,085
(Woman) Sex, after all,
can't just be about your desires.

66
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,630
To be really synapse-sparking,
it has to be about tending to your own

67
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,596
and your partner's individual
desires, wants and needs,

68
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,592
and finding the glorious intersections
between those points.

69
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,828
(Man) Flirting is man's mating ritual.

70
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,288
It's the first way we indicate desire,

71
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,667
and a host of industries
are built up around it,

72
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:41,255
from speed-dating to more traditional
singles' nights, pubs to clubs.

73
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,174
A plethora of social occasions
are little more

74
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,720
than thinly-disguised
seduction opportunities.

75
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,466
(Woman) Many people complain
that nightclubs become duller

76
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,718
once you stop being single.

77
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,098
Which just goes to show
how carefully they are designed

78
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,645
to help find a mate.

79
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,145
And while you may not necessarily
get a chance for a good conversation,

80
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:09,617
You certainly get a good opportunity
to scope out potential conquests.

81
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,363
(Man) Flirting gives a subtle
indication of interest -

82
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,537
suggesting you are up
for forming a deeper connection,

83
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,459
but without the risk that comes
with a more direct approach.

84
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,671
(Woman) Things like direct eye contact
and an open smile

85
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,129
can act to indicate desire
and suggest attraction.

86
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,133
(Man) Although some people
are innately flirtatious,

87
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,682
it's also a skill that can be
learned and developed.

88
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,394
(Woman) Practicing flirting helps
overcome lack of self-confidence

89
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,233
and the fear of rejection.

90
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,729
The main goal is to spark
the imagination of your target.

91
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,112
(Man) One key thing to keep in mind
when you're attempting to flirt

92
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,034
is your body language.

93
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,785
Although you don't want to completely
invade someone's personal space,

94
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,828
a bit of encroachment
sends the signal

95
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,211
that there's more than just
chatting going on here.

96
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,501
(Woman) A welcoming smile,
a casual touch of the hand,

97
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,757
or simply listening
to someone attentively

98
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,384
will all help indicate your attraction,

99
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,300
though some prefer
the more overt approach.

100
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,887
(Man) Leaning towards someone,

101
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,186
which is often necessary
in a noisy environment,

102
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,400
is another way to show your interest.

103
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,772
The more confident you look,
the more attractive you'll seem.

104
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,281
(Woman) By relaxing, enjoying yourself,
and using those signals skilfully,

105
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,575
you can establish whether there's
a connection with a potential mate,

106
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,162
and, if there is,
who knows where it could lead?

107
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,894
(Man) Sex is a core human need,

108
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,273
as natural as breathing,
sleeping and eating.

109
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,358
And, as with all these needs,

110
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,286
the hunger for sex can be
a strong motivating force.

111
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,535
Our bodies ignite the desire for sex,

112
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,374
and once the craving is there,

113
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,621
it's the first step towards the joys
that intimacy can bring.

114
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,256
(Woman) Physical attraction
is an essential part of desire.

115
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,346
Sometimes, just the sight
of a muscular pair of arms

116
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,263
or a hint of cleavage can activate
a person's sex hormones,

117
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,604
which then rouse the body and mind
into action.

118
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,848
(Man) The trickiest thing
about fulfilling desires

119
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:51,445
can be finding the person
who really clicks with you sexually.

120
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,282
(Woman) We're genetically
hotwired to be drawn to partners

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,030
who seem to be good
breeding stock.

122
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,373
Youth, health and strength
are universally appealing.

123
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,995
But more than that,

124
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,290
we're also attracted to people
whose pheromones indicate

125
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,506
they have a complementary
immune system to our own.

126
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,800
When we meet a match,

127
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,720
the brain releases a complex
cocktail of chemicals

128
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,298
that produce a rush
of excitement and well being,

129
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,310
bonding us to a lover
and making us feel content.

130
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,645
(Man) The body conspires
to enhance these chemicals.

131
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,690
The pupils dilate, making us
look more attractive to a partner.

132
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,315
Meanwhile, the blood makes
a bee-line to parts of the body

133
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,650
that openly indicate desire.

134
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:43,326
Resulting in external signs such
as erect nipples and a hardening penis,

135
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,289
which all serve to arouse a partner
if they happen to catch a glimpse,

136
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,836
even through our clothes.

137
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,424
(Woman) While research has shown
that 90% of long-term couples

138
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,546
feel they are with the right partner,

139
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,346
over 50% of marriages
end in divorce.

140
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,014
Still, strong physical attraction
and great sex can develop

141
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,978
provided the couple bring enough energy
and enthusiasm to their intimate lives-.

142
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,529
(Man) Once the feeling
of desire kicks in,

143
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,905
we use the same kinds of seduction
techniques found in the animal kingdom.

144
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:26,040
Grooming, preening, teasing
and sometimes territorial behavior.

145
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,959
Simply placing a hand
on a lover's arm in public

146
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,545
can indicate to others
that they are taken,

147
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:36,509
and kissing in public is a clear indication
to others to keep their hands off.

148
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,507
(Woman) Sadly, these feelings
don't always last.

149
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,474
The most powerful chemicals
of attraction

150
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,643
only last for around three months,

151
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,763
with almost all of them fading away
within 18 months.

152
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,938
This is why many couples may feel
the magic has faded.

153
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:06,163
(Man) They identify the feeling of love
as being the heady mix of chemicals,

154
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,455
which is why it's so important to develop
more than merely a sexual relationship

155
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,702
when you first meet a lover.

156
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,708
But, with continued effort,

157
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,837
there's no reason that
a long-term loving relationship

158
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,552
shouldn't result in even better sex

159
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,218
than the chemical-driven highs
of the early days.

160
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,485
(Woman) It's only when we kiss

161
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,030
that chemistry really has
the chance to work its magic.

162
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,784
With the right partner, the world
shrinks down into nothing but the point

163
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,997
at which your lips are making
contact with your lover's.

164
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,458
As the kiss deepens,
the blood rushes into your lips,

165
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,837
indicating your desire,
increasing sensitivity

166
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,680
and making them firm with arousal.

167
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,892
(Man) That first kiss can
be thick with passion.

168
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,016
While it can be tempting
to dive in tongue first,

169
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,395
the entire experience becomes
so much more enticing

170
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,322
if you take a softly-softly approach.

171
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,027
(Woman) Looking into
each other's eyes

172
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,534
as you breathe
each other's breath,

173
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,583
each waiting for the other
to make the first move,

174
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,501
can create one of the most intoxicating
moments of a burgeoning relationship.

175
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,386
(Man) Going in too hard and fast
to start with

176
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:51,056
can indicate inexperience or a lack
of concern for your partner's enjoyment.

177
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,764
Good things come to those who wait,

178
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,234
and never is this truer
than with kissing.

179
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,028
While wet kisses do have their place,

180
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:06,450
an overactive, probing tongue suggests
you want to rush to the finishing line

181
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:11,702
rather than enjoying the sensual
pleasures that a kiss has to offer.

182
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,539
(Woman) Many a relationship has been
thwarted by a lack-lustre first kiss.

183
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,915
While technical skill has a part to play,

184
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,918
if there isn't that magical zing
when your lips first meet,

185
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,092
it can indicate there may not be
enough physical compatibility

186
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,181
for passion to grow.

187
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,558
(Man) Licking your own lips when
your mouth is mere millimeters away

188
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,605
from the object of your affections

189
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:46,824
delivers a sensual tease that will make
them yearn to press their lips to yours.

190
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,192
And taking that first kiss slowly,

191
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,696
letting your lips delicately
touch your lover's

192
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,160
before pulling away
to extend the tease

193
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,494
will serve to make the stomach flip
and the heart race.

194
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,961
(Woman) By teasing and withdrawing,
deepening the kiss then pulling away,

195
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,634
you help to build the passion
slowly and seductively

196
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,977
while still leaving your lover
in no doubt as to your desires.

197
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,392
(Man) That said,
as your relationship progresses,

198
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,605
deep, hard kissing can be
an intoxicating way to show your lover

199
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,486
that you still desire them
as much as you did

200
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,659
in the early days
of your relationship.

201
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,996
A passionate kiss
can be achingly intense.

202
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,708
Fueling the desire to let your lips
explore your partner's face,

203
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,999
neck, shoulders and beyond.

204
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,294
It will make your skin tingle
and blood pound,

205
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,669
and leave your lover
filled with anticipation.

206
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,840
(Woman) And kissing isn't just
about the lips.

207
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,893
Leisurely exploring your lover's neck,
earlobes and shoulders

208
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,061
can be achingly sensual.

209
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:03,817
Many women list their neck as one of
their most sensitive erogenous zones,

210
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,154
with delicate neck kissing
acting as more of a turn-on

211
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:11,525
than a more obvious approach
of caressing the breasts.

212
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,576
(Man) While love bites are best
avoided after adolescence,

213
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,826
gently nibbling and teasing suction
can send shivers of anticipation

214
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,582
through your lover's body.

215
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,088
(Woman) Kissing is addictive.

216
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,551
It forms a strong, lasting bond
between you and your partner.

217
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,384
It's a well-known truth that
when relationships break down,

218
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,229
it's usually the first kissing
that stops even before sex.

219
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,563
Think of kissing as the litmus test
of how well you're getting along.

220
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,320
(Man) The lips are densely
populated with nerves.

221
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,698
An intense session of kissing ensures
those nerves,

222
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,535
combined with those on the tongue
and in the mouth,

223
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,454
constantly send messages
to the brain.

224
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,541
This helps unleash numerous
sexy chemicals

225
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,712
that make you feel relaxed, aroused,
connected to a partner,

226
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,916
and ready to take things
to the next level.

227
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,055
(Woman) People stay in love
when they feel valued,

228
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,270
adored and appreciated sexually.

229
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,389
Don't be complacent.

230
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,732
Keep making your partner feel sexy,

231
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,232
keep flirting,
and don't let the kissing stop.

232
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,031
You never know where it might lead.

233
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:53,844
(Man) Touch is one of our most
basic communication methods.

234
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,673
However, only the caress of a lover
has the ability

235
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,173
to set your nerves alight

236
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,853
and make your mind explore
the infinite possibilities

237
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:08,066
contained within than blissful moment
when skin meets skin.

238
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,188
(Woman) Even something as simple
as your fingertips meeting your lover's

239
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,114
can be charged with erotic promise.

240
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,572
(Man) The average human has
an impressive two square metres

241
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,661
of skin surface area.

242
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,124
That makes the skin,
packed with millions of nerve endings,

243
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,293
your body's largest erogenous zone.

244
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,090
All it takes to activate it
is a touch from the right person.

245
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,431
(Woman) Stroking each other helps you
rouse each other's desires,

246
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:45,019
getting the juices flowing,
and making you both eager for more.

247
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:56,357
(Man) Caressing your partner's body
teaches you its landscape.

248
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,860
It's only by exploring
that you can discover exactly

249
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,369
what makes your lover tick.

250
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:06,492
Although the breasts and genitals
are the obvious erogenous zones,

251
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,374
By allowing your hands
to roam more thoroughly,

252
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,001
you can discover your lover's
unique body blueprint.

253
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,172
(Woman) For some, a finger traced
along the spine,

254
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,004
back of the knee
or the nape of the neck,

255
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:23,555
can produce a strong and erotic charge
as more X-rated exploration.

256
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:28,605
For others, delicate kisses
to the buttocks, inner ankle or toes

257
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,773
are the key to sexual bliss.

258
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,855
There's no right or wrong,
simply what your lover likes best.

259
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,032
(Man) As with most sexual contact,

260
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,202
caressing a lover builds
a feeling of intimacy

261
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,374
and releases the cuddle
hormone oxytocin.

262
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,374
This makes you more receptive
to touching and being touched,

263
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,373
sending the signal that
you can relax into your arousal.

264
00:18:55,468 --> 00:19:00,929
Building these feelings with slow kisses,
tender eye gazing and teasing strokes

265
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,890
will only serve to heighten
the anticipation.

266
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,929
(Woman) Mixing up the types
of caresses and areas being caressed

267
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,522
helps keep the skin's nerve endings
responsive.

268
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,941
And there's no reason
you can't touch yourself

269
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,562
while your lover is touching you.

270
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,489
Being comfortable enough to masturbate
in front of your lover

271
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,733
shows that you trust them
and helps them to get to know

272
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,910
the type of touch that
you most enjoy.

273
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,293
(Man) There's no reason that touch
should be limited to your hands.

274
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,130
The lips and teeth can deliver
exquisite sensations,

275
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,468
helping your lover feel worshipped
on every inch of their body.

276
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,467
Sensual kisses and
whispered sweet nothings

277
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,810
will all add to the mood and
make you both desperate for more.

278
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,765
(Woman) Take time
when caressing a lover.

279
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,020
Give them the chance for their mind
to imagine what's going to come next.

280
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,105
Once someone's brain is stimulated,

281
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,484
it's almost guaranteed
that the body will follow.

282
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,541
(Man) Women in particular
appreciate slow foreplay.

283
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:16,042
While only 25% of women climax
from penetrative sex alone,

284
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,336
this figure increases to over 75%

285
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,801
if their partner spends
more than 20 minutes

286
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,342
on touching
and other forms of foreplay.

287
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,853
(Woman) Many people fantasize
when their lover is caressing them.

288
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,222
This is entirely natural and healthy,

289
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,521
even if you are not fantasizing
about your lover.

290
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,107
(Man) Communicating your desire
sexually with a partner,

291
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,990
whether verbally or through the way
you groan and move your body,

292
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,490
is one of the easiest ways
to get what you want in bed.

293
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,209
And continue to communicate
whilst you are being pleasured.

294
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,709
Simply moaning when your lover
caresses you in a way that you enjoy

295
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,008
and staying silent when they do
something that doesn't hit the spot

296
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,803
will help them learn
what you most enjoy.

297
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,603
(Woman) Most people simply
want their lover to be happy,

298
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,188
and you will generally find if you have
the confidence to ask for what you want,

299
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,857
you will get what you need.

300
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,842
(Woman) Touching yourself is
as important as touching a lover.

301
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,587
Until you truly know your own body,

302
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,885
you're unlikely to be able
to guide a partner

303
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:54,762
on how to satisfy your desires and
your own personal pleasure zones.

304
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,490
(Man) While some people
stigmatize masturbation,

305
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,827
it really is entirely normal and healthy.

306
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,655
Playing with your own body
helps build confidence

307
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,079
and teaches you about
your own sexual responses.

308
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,625
(Woman) It's helpful to be aware
of your many erogenous zones,

309
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,706
not just the genitals.

310
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,295
Everyone is different.

311
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,385
There is no right or wrong way
to stimulate yourself,

312
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,305
so experiment with different methods.

313
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,596
(Man) Men have an arsenal of techniques
at their disposal.

314
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,775
They can use a lubed up hand
to rub and squeeze the penis and balls.

315
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,941
They can experiment with different grips,
using one hand or both,

316
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,236
or even rub their penis
against something.

317
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,613
Once you've explored your body alone,

318
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,994
show your partner what you've learnt.

319
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:58,538
Side by side, masturbation can be
one of the best ways to demonstrate

320
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,661
what turns you on to your partner.

321
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,759
(Woman) When it comes
to pleasuring your man,

322
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,130
explore every inch
of his penis and beyond,

323
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,183
stroking him from his balls
to the tip of his shaft.

324
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,770
Follow his hands on how best
to stimulate his penis.

325
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,726
If he is not fully erect,

326
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,355
grip the penis and gently pump it
with your hand.

327
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,865
You may also want to coat your palm
with lubricant

328
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:35,408
and then grasp his shaft and start
to move your hand up and down.

329
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,209
(Man) Experiment with
different techniques.

330
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,171
Try holding his shaft
right underneath the head

331
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,166
between thumb and finger
and rubbing it.

332
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,010
Or grasping the shaft firmly
in a lubricated hand,

333
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,222
with your thumb on his fraenulum
and slide your hand up and down.

334
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,977
Or use one hand to stroke his shaft
with smooth, even strokes

335
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,190
while the other one moves around
the head in a circular motion.

336
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,605
(Woman) Watch your lover's
body language as you play,

337
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,855
and check whether he likes what
you're doing as you go along.

338
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,489
And don't ignore his balls.

339
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:16,077
Feel free to squeeze and tickle them,
but always be gentle,

340
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,617
because a bruised testicle
is a sure-fire way

341
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,582
to get a man immediately
out of the mood.

342
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,334
(Man) As a man nears orgasm,

343
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,964
his balls will tighten and you'll feel
his penis start to pulse.

344
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,382
It'll also probably feel harder.

345
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,212
Maintain what you're doing
unless you want to extend the tease,

346
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,923
in which case change the technique.

347
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,268
(Woman) There's a lot to be learned
from watching your partner.

348
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,229
Women generally tend
to prefer softer, slower

349
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,062
and more manual stimulation
than men.

350
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,274
Watch how she softly rubs
the shaft of the clitoris.

351
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:58,362
Going straight for the clitoral tip can
be uncomfortable for many women.

352
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,491
Look at how she swells with arousal
and keeps the pressure light.

353
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,662
(Man) Women tend to prefer
the gentler approach to men,

354
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:11,087
so notice how her fingers circle
around her clitoris or tease her labia,

355
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,339
rather than pressing hard
or rubbing fast.

356
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,013
(Woman) When masturbating
in front of a partner,

357
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,388
be honest about what you really do
when you're alone.

358
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,391
Although it can be tempting
to put on a graphic display,

359
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,348
particularly if you watch
a lot of adult films together,

360
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,816
there is no point going
for lots of penetration

361
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,486
and spreading of your labia
or finger licking,

362
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,323
if what you really enjoy is
a light circling of your clitoris.

363
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,909
Your partner can only learn
from what you are doing,

364
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,575
if you show what you genuinely enjoy.

365
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:46,163
It'll be even more of a turn-on if he can
see you getting wetter as you play.

366
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,666
(Man) It generally takes a woman
longer to climax than a man.

367
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,836
So, if you're going for a mutual
masturbation session,

368
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,632
it's a good idea to apply the adage:
"ladies first".

369
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,929
That way, you'll both be satisfied

370
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,892
and interested in what each other
is doing throughout.

371
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,431
Watching your lover masturbate

372
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,267
and then joining in
as she gets closer to orgasm,

373
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,315
using all the new tricks
you have learned from observing,

374
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,359
can be one of the sexiest show-and-tell
sessions you will ever experience.

375
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,201
(Man) It helps if you let your lover
show you by guiding your hand

376
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,821
how best she likes to be stimulated.

377
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:27,917
Feel around her G-spot,
a few inches inside on the upper wall.

378
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,038
You'll know when you've found it
when you find a area that swells

379
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,336
when you stroke it
with a come-hither motion.

380
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:38,678
(Woman) G-spot stimulation can be
the pathway to female ejaculation.

381
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,590
(Man) Don't be afraid
to show your lover

382
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,765
how much you enjoy watching
her masturbate by touching yourself.

383
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,125
(Woman) And many women find
watching their partner masturbate

384
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:53,985
To be a turn-on too, so you may
spur her nearer to her orgasm.

385
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,195
(Man) Conversely,
most men are aroused

386
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,490
by watching a woman lose herself
in sensual pleasure.

387
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,365
So don't be afraid to let
your growing excitement show.

388
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,619
It's more than likely to make your lover
desperately want to join in.

389
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,708
(Woman) The man should add
more fingers

390
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,127
as he feels his lover
getting more aroused,

391
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,170
and use his other hand to caress
her clitoris, neck or nipples

392
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,467
or to stroke himself.

393
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,327
(Man) Frontage, or rubbing your genitals
against your partners,

394
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,583
can be a wonderfully stimulating twist

395
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,503
on more traditional methods
of masturbation.

396
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,301
Just remember that you still
need to use a condom

397
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:04,673
unless you know you're safe
from STD's and pregnancy.

398
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,426
(Woman) When orgasm hits,
don't be afraid to let it show.

399
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,638
Not only does it let your partner know
they should stop what they are doing,

400
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,520
to avoid touching
over-sensitized areas,

401
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,398
it can also act as an incredible
turn-on for them,

402
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,024
spurring them towards their own climax.

403
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,286
(Man) Masturbating a partner
isn't just great foreplay,

404
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:36,333
it can make a refreshing change from,
or a wonderfully sensual alternative to,

405
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,752
full-on sexual intercourse.

406
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:03,440
(Man) Just about every animal on the
planet uses licking to convey affection.

407
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,901
But humans have taken it
to a whole new level.

408
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:11,410
There are numerous ways in which
people use their tongue on a lover.

409
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:16,331
Delicate licking, sensual lapping,
and tracing outlines on a lover's skin,

410
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,287
all have their place.

411
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,542
And licking isn't just reserved
for the most obvious body parts.

412
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,510
Exploring your lover's
entire body with your tongue

413
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,510
can make them tingle all over.

414
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,355
(Woman) Going from a standing start
straight to oral can be very sexy.

415
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,945
But if you make a lover crave your
tongue on their most intimate parts,

416
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:47,650
they're more likely to be aroused and
eager when you finally get down there.

417
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,750
(Man) The longer you extend the tease,

418
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:01,122
the more powerful a lover's
eventual orgasm is likely to be.

419
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,756
Whether that happens with your mouth
or fingers or full-blown sex.

420
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:12,266
(Woman) Many women find oral sex
the easiest way to climax.

421
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,182
As the clitoris is much richer
in nerves than the penis,

422
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,477
start gently rather than sucking too hard.

423
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,818
(Man) You should be
sensitive enough to feel

424
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,193
whether she wants your licks
stronger or faster.

425
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:34,197
Even simply breathing on the clitoris
can be incredibly arousing,

426
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:39,499
building her desire and making her ache
to feel your mouth around her.

427
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:43,502
Try using the flat side of your tongue
rather than the tip

428
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,459
as some women prefer
a big ice-cream lick

429
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,091
to pressure of the point
of the tongue on the clitoris.

430
00:30:55,187 --> 00:31:00,182
(Woman) The golden rule is not to see it
as a race to get her to a finishing line,

431
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:04,186
but to delight in losing yourself
in a joyous activity.

432
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,609
Some women can feel self-conscious
about receiving oral sex,

433
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,986
but if you show that
you're not only willing

434
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,360
but actively want to take your time,

435
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,154
it will reassure her that
she smells and tastes great,

436
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,115
and can relax into enjoying herself too.

437
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,040
And with her relaxation
can come great orgasms.

438
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,720
(Man) As a woman nears orgasm,
her labia and clitoris will swell

439
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,893
and the wetness will increase.

440
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,854
At this point, you can add
a finger or two.

441
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,691
Or try more intense contact
using the tip of your tongue.

442
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,061
But again, build up slowly,

443
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,940
as otherwise she may
lose the moment entirely-.

444
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,660
(Woman) Vary how you begin oral sex.

445
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,489
Putting your tongue on the shaft
of a hardening penis

446
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,747
or engorged clitoris through underwear
can be wildly erotic-.

447
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,918
Try lapping at the pubic mound,
the inner thighs, the balls,

448
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:11,419
and occasionally let your tongue
snake inside the underwear-.

449
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,556
(Man) While there are numerous
fellatio techniques,

450
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,676
they fall into two basic approaches.

451
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,559
For a slow and gentle tease,
or as a wonderful warm-up,

452
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,524
lick the length of the penis
from balls to shaft

453
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,071
before gently flicking your tongue
over the generally more sensitive head.

454
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,111
To extend the anticipation,

455
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,114
move back from his glands
to the base of his penis

456
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,657
and work your way up.

457
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,702
Or from side to side,
or to his inner thighs,

458
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,700
before moving back up.

459
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,247
(Woman) Try playing your hair
over his shaft

460
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,085
as you delicately lick the tip,

461
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,794
softly sucking the skin between his balls
into your mouth.

462
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,967
Or even sucking his balls entirely
into your mouth.

463
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,888
Do take it carefully though,
as the balls can be incredibly sensitive

464
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,595
and not all men like them
being played with.

465
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,517
(Man) Alternatively,
or as things heat up,

466
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:11,275
go for more intense sucking,
moving your head up and down,

467
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,740
so that he can watch his penis
vanishing into your mouth.

468
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,737
Many men find it extra hot
to make eye contact at this point,

469
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:22,240
so he can see how much
you love what you're doing.

470
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,457
(Woman) Make sure you keep
your teeth guarded behind your lips,

471
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,751
and don't be afraid to set the pace.

472
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,796
If he thrusts too hard
or at the wrong moment,

473
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,256
it can set off the gag reflex.

474
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,506
Keeping one hand on the penis
as you perform oral sex

475
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,262
will also help you stay in control.

476
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:47,856
What you are aiming for is creating
a warm, wet, tight combination

477
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:52,103
that emulates the feeling of him
sliding in and out of your vagina.

478
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:57,904
(Man) Masturbating the shaft or
softly tugging or cupping the balls,

479
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,321
or using your fingers to put
some pressure on his perineum,

480
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,743
that area between his balls and anus,

481
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,957
can send him over the edge.

482
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,872
You may want to get an all-clear from
him

483
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,962
before you go sticking your finger
in his anus, however.

484
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:16,177
Some men love it, but others will
not take such an intrusion kindly.

485
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,385
(Woman) If it's the taste of semen
that you really don't like,

486
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,387
take the penis at the back of your throat

487
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,810
to bypass the majority
of your taste buds,

488
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,232
and if you're squeamish
about swallowing,

489
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,935
withdraw your mouth altogether,

490
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,859
and masturbate him to orgasm.

491
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,530
(Man) Different people prefer
different techniques,

492
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,207
so read your lover's body language.

493
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,459
Don't be shy about asking questions,

494
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,455
even when you're in the middle
of pleasuring your partner.

495
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,209
And, above all, focus on enjoying
the sensual pleasure

496
00:34:56,553 --> 00:35:00,763
of having your lover's most
intimate parts in your mouth.

497
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,683
Some people get just as aroused
by giving oral sex as receiving it,

498
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:09,555
and you may become one of them
if you get your mind into the right state.

499
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:14,439
It really can be every bit as good
to give as to receive.

500
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:36,715
(Woman) Whilst straight-forward sex
is perfectly wonderful in itself,

501
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,677
many people also enjoy
some form of kink or fetish.

502
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,467
For some, it may simply be
the exhibitionist thrill

503
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,259
of watching a lover
strip or masturbate.

504
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,477
Being able to observe a partner
in such an intimate way

505
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,515
and know that they're indulging
for your gratification

506
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,102
can deliver an intense sexual charge.

507
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,959
(Man) Others find that sexy lingerie
adds an extra frisson to sex

508
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,169
that nothing else can match.

509
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,998
Dressing up and undressing
for seduction

510
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,006
can add a sense of naughtiness
and occasion,

511
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,925
particularly if a lover is
appreciative of the effort

512
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,640
and lavishes you with compliments.

513
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,805
Stockings and suspenders are popular,

514
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,932
and giving a discreet flash
of stocking top

515
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,102
when you're getting out of a car
on the way to dinner

516
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,809
can make a man's mind
wander all night.

517
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:41,238
Even simply seeing a pair of stockings
being slowly unfurled up a leg

518
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,362
can be enough to create
a spark of desire.

519
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,678
(Woman) And of course,
getting kinky isn't simply

520
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,351
about the way you dress or undress.

521
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,864
Spanking is one of the most
common fetishes,

522
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,742
often forming part of sex in which
one partner takes a dominant role,

523
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,290
and the other a submissive one.

524
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:42,007
With this scenario, even something as
innocuous as tickling can be a turn-on.

525
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,024
(Man) While most people seek out
the pleasure of touch,

526
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,696
the sensation of pain which also
releases a flood of feel-good endorphins

527
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,952
can be just as energizing.

528
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,909
This is exacerbated
if the spanking starts slowly

529
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,582
and gradually becomes more intense.

530
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,974
(Woman) If a long, hardish
spanking is administered,

531
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,356
it is essential to comfort
your lover afterwards,

532
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:48,156
otherwise they may suffer a come-down
from their body's own natural high-.

533
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:52,487
And teaming pleasure with pain
can really increase the sensations.

534
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,083
(Man) Even if a kink
doesn't do it for you,

535
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,506
by indulging your lover,
you may well find yourself

536
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:12,506
bringing a previously unknown
spark into your relationship.

537
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,475
Fetishes can be based
deep in the subconscious,

538
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,765
and connect you
to your lover's sexual psyche

539
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,685
in a way that non-kinky sex doesn't.

540
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,140
And you never know,

541
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:26,027
just because a particular kink or quirk
has never appealed to you,

542
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,903
it doesn't mean you won't enjoy it
if you actually try it.

543
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,329
(Woman) You can take things
to another level

544
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,119
by bringing kinky role-play
into the occasion.

545
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,210
Many role-play scenarios
involve a power play:

546
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,917
doctors and nurses,
escorts and clients,

547
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,040
seducers and virgins.

548
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:51,254
And you don't necessarily have
to dress up or use specialist props.

549
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,965
Simply using your imagination
can be all that's required

550
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,095
to transport you to a castle dungeon
or an Arabian harem.

551
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,983
(Man) Bondage, domination,
submission and masochism,

552
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,398
collectively known as BDSM,

553
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,194
allow exploration of power roles
within relationships.

554
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,157
Some people get a thrill
out of relinquishing

555
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,326
or seizing control
in the bedroom,

556
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,247
particularly if this runs contrary
to their position in everyday life.

557
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:23,248
Household props can easily
be adapted to kinky purposes.

558
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:27,168
Stockings or silk scarves
can become bondage ropes.

559
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,794
(Woman) By trying both dominant
and submissive roles with a lover,

560
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,971
you may tap into previously
unacknowledged desires.

561
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,558
However, before engaging
in any fantasy or role-play,

562
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,186
make sure boundaries
are clearly defined.

563
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:46,025
What may seem entertaining in fantasy
can be too extreme in reality,

564
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,442
and levels that you think
you'd never step beyond

565
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:52,940
may become surpassable
when you're in the heat of the moment.

566
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,942
(Man) Before you start playing,

567
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,869
it's essential to set a safe word
which means stop

568
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:02,036
and that your partner promises
faithfully to adhere to.

569
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,791
Many people enjoy using the words
'no' or 'stop' as part of the role-play,

570
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,834
so choose a word such as 'red'

571
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,085
which you are less likely to use
during the sex-play.

572
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,391
(Woman) Some couples draw
inspiration for their fantasy play

573
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,139
from X-rated material:

574
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,185
reading erotic stories,
looking at sexy magazines

575
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,102
and watching adult videos.

576
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,353
Most men have looked at some form
of pornography in their lives,

577
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,438
although figures for women
are on the increase too.

578
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,321
(Man) Producing home porn,

579
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,616
whether in the form of pictures
or videos of oneselfes,

580
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,911
has seen a massive boost
in the digital age.

581
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,916
While you should never take photos or
videos of anyone without their consent,

582
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,795
role-playing photographer and model
can be a hot fantasy.

583
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,297
And you can always delete any images
you take afterwards.

584
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:59,177
You may find it safest to ensure
that neither of you is identifiable

585
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,268
in any home porn make,
should anyone find the footage.

586
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,014
(Woman) Unless you're happy
to be exhibitionists,

587
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,017
keep your faces out of shot,

588
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,820
and also ensure you hide
any unique piercings or tattoos

589
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,531
to keep your identity
properly protected.

590
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,910
That goes doubly so if you intend
to post your footage online,

591
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:24,202
on the user-generated adult websites
that are now in abundance.

592
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,505
(Man) Sometimes
a perfectly passable sex life

593
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,721
just needs a little tweak to move it
into the mind-blowing category.

594
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,573
(Woman) In the end, good old
romance can often be best

595
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,908
for maintaining the spice
in a relationship.

596
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:06,035
Affection and appreciation are often
the choicest aphrodisiacs in life.

597
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,094
(Man) Sex toys have been around
for thousands of years.

598
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:32,354
Early dildos, known as Olisbos,
were sold in Greece around 5,000 BC.

599
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,939
Around the same time,
Ben Wa balls,

600
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,613
still used as vaginal toning devices
and stimulators to this day,

601
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,361
were created in southeast Asia.

602
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,693
(Woman) Olive oil was mentioned
as a sexual lubricant

603
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,746
in texts dating back to 35080.

604
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,582
Although it shouldn't actually
be used as a lubricant

605
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,876
as it can cause condoms to break.

606
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:58,133
(Man) And cock rings, once made
from the dried eyelids of goats,

607
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,219
were used back in 1,200 AD.

608
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:05,181
By 1600, these evolved
into carved ivory rings,

609
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,394
some with studs used to stimulate
the clitoris during intercourse.

610
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,815
(Woman) Vibrators were invented
in Victorian times

611
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,527
to provide orgasms as a medical cure
for hysteria or womb disease

612
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,237
in female patients.

613
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,405
The machines were administered
by doctors

614
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,991
who previously had developed
tired wrists

615
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,329
from having to cure
this hysteria manually.

616
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,373
(Man) Nowadays sex toys
are no longer taboo.

617
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,665
At a sex emporium, you can pick up
clitoral stimulators, dildos and vibrators

618
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,917
of every shape and size.

619
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:43,796
The choice in men's toys has also grown
significantly over the last decade,

620
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,047
most notably with the arrival
of a masturbator

621
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,425
looking like an ordinary torch.

622
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,477
(Woman) Around half of all women
in the West

623
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,308
have a sex toy of some kind,

624
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,857
and almost 80% of them
use them within relationships.

625
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:04,449
You can use them to stimulate nipples,
a clitoris, vagina or anus,

626
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,990
or indeed the penis, balls or prostate.

627
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,167
(Man) 80 don't see toys as something
purely to use on a woman.

628
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,629
Even toys such as the Rabbit,
designed with women in mind,

629
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,581
can be used on the man.

630
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,505
Try teaming it with oral
or manual stimulation.

631
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:26,676
If it doesn't float his boat,
you can simply put the toy aside.

632
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:31,893
If it works for him, you can both
enjoy more explosive climaxes.

633
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,099
(Woman) Women, though, often
need more stimulation than men

634
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,520
to attain orgasm,

635
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:43,237
and what man is capable of 6,000 revs
per minute and at the touch of a button?

636
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,742
Many women who do use sex toys
on a regular basis

637
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,909
experience more frequent orgasms,
have increased sexual confidence

638
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,826
and report greater satisfaction
with their partners.

639
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:00,505
(Man) This means that rather than being
a threat to your relationship,

640
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:04,297
vibrators and other sex toys
can be positively beneficial.

641
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,679
(Woman) When it comes
to introducing your partner

642
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,018
to the concept of using
sex toys together,

643
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,895
judge it carefully.

644
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:19,516
Some couples may be open enough
to say, "Fancy giving this a go?"

645
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,352
when others could be intimidated.

646
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:26,026
(Man) Not so long ago, the idea
of a woman using a strap-on dildo

647
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,405
to penetrate her male partner
would have been shocking.

648
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:33,409
But now you can buy backdoor toys,
G-spot and prostate massage's

649
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:37,538
to help couples reach the parts
that never see the light of day.

650
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,130
(Woman) Some toys nowadays
are designed for double penetration.

651
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,473
With enough foreplay
and plenty of lube,

652
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,269
it's amazing the pleasures that
such double stimulation can bring.

653
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,473
Then there's the extra dimension
of adding to sexual fantasy.

654
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,274
You can imagine group sex

655
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,695
without exposing yourself to
the emotional risks of actually trying it.

656
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,235
(Man) Remember, though,
the key word is 'play'.

657
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,989
So, whatever toys you choose
to incorporate into your sex life,

658
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,163
be sure that the end result is fun.

659
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,011
(Woman) Though many couples stick
to two or three favourite positions

660
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,387
throughout their lives,

661
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,389
there are actually hundreds of positions

662
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,397
that people can use
to have sexual intercourse.

663
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,316
On the internet, you can find
step-by-step guides

664
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:50,941
to doing everything from
the 'Pile-driver' to the 'Pinwheel'.

665
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:59,408
(Man) But there are really just
five main approaches to consider

666
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,205
when deciding which way to do it.

667
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,913
Man on top.

668
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,965
Woman on top.

669
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,510
From behind.

670
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,178
Sitting.

671
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,302
And standing.

672
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,764
(Woman) Then there's always
anal sex to consider as well,

673
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,978
but we'll get to that later.

674
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:32,316
(Man) Man on top, also known
as the 'missionary position',

675
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,284
is often considered
old-fashioned or dull.

676
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,201
But it actually offers a woman
a greater chance of orgasm

677
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,790
because it allows for great
clitoral stimulation,

678
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,459
particularly if you don't rush it.

679
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:46,880
This position is also conducive
to passionate eye contact

680
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,874
breast fondling and,
if the woman bends her knees

681
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,801
or wraps her legs around her partner,

682
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,217
deeper penetration
and G-spot stimulation.

683
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:01,261
(Woman) The woman has easy access
to caress the man's chest and nipples,

684
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,980
should they be an erogenous zone
for him.

685
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:08,940
She can also easily grip his shoulders
and rake her nails down his back,

686
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:13,110
and of course there's lots of scope
for both of you to kiss.

687
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,819
(Man) Missionary position
is a great starting-off point,

688
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:21,326
that lends itself to both
sensual and animalistic sex.

689
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,827
And there's nothing to stop you moving
from slow and teasing missionary

690
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,791
to hard and fast rutting in one session.

691
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,091
(Woman) Rotating the hips
in a figure of eight motion,

692
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,390
moving your bodies
closer together or further away,

693
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,640
or adding your own unique twist
to missionary sex,

694
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,600
such as this reverse doggie,

695
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:53,689
can all increase sensitivity
and allow deeper penetration.

696
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,524
(Man) There's a reason it's one
of the most popular sexual positions

697
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,114
with men and women alike.

698
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,113
(Woman) The next option to consider
is woman on top.

699
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,407
This position allows the woman
to be more in control

700
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:08,336
of the pace and power of thrusting
and the depth of penetration.

701
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,459
She can also be more in charge
of tending to the clitoris,

702
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,758
either by actively grinding it
against her partner's pubic bone,

703
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,097
or by playing with it herself.

704
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,801
The man has easy access
to the woman's breasts,

705
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,269
and again, it's easy to kiss.

706
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,057
(Man) As with missionary,
there are myriad variations

707
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,604
of woman-on-top sex.

708
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,522
It can be a seductive dance

709
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,150
with a woman grinding her hips
against her partner,

710
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:39,864
looking into his eyes
as the pair rock to mutual bliss.

711
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,950
Or it can be a passionate and dominant
exchange

712
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,782
in which the woman hungrily
takes what she wants

713
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,285
from a willingly supportive man.

714
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,204
(Woman) For an intriguing twist
on woman on top,

715
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,841
there is always the seated position
with the man sitting on a chair

716
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,507
or on the edge of a bed,
with his partner straddling him.

717
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,134
(Man) This is a great option

718
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,349
if you prefer your woman-on-top
approach to be more mutual,

719
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,807
as it's easier for the man to simply
drop the woman onto her back,

720
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:15,316
should he decide he wants to take
a more dominant role in the proceedings.

721
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:19,115
(Woman) Woman-on-top sex
can be slow and tender

722
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,950
or hard and fast,

723
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,695
and this is the ideal position
if a man is well-endowed,

724
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,657
as it allows the woman to decide exactly
how much she is going to take

725
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,368
and how hard she is going to take it.

726
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,208
(Man) It allows the man to enjoy sex
a more relaxed way,

727
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:39,214
all that thrusting can be hell
on the thigh muscles,

728
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,384
though it still allows him
enough freedom to thrust upwards

729
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,182
should he crave deeper penetration.

730
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,269
(Woman) As with
the missionary position,

731
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,105
woman-on-top gives
plenty of clitoral stimulation,

732
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,354
making it a great position
for mutual orgasm.

733
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,907
(Man) Sex from behind,
or doggie style,

734
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,904
allows for the deepest penetration
and G-spot stimulation.

735
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:09,582
The man has easy access to kiss
and nibble the neck and shoulders,

736
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:13,411
caress the back
or stroke the clitoris during sex.

737
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,289
He can cup the woman's breasts,
kiss her body,

738
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:20,589
and generally lavish almost
every inch of her with affection.

739
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,506
(Woman) Many woman
enjoy doggie style

740
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,308
because it makes even
the smallest man feel larger,

741
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,977
and the woman can deepen
penetration even further

742
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,268
by pressing backwards
onto the man's penis.

743
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,769
(Man) Although it gets low scores
for intimacy and clitoral contact,

744
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,897
doggie style sex usually
receives high marks from guys

745
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,191
because it allows for aggressive
thrusting

746
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:47,537
and it has a kind of raw
animalistic feel to it.

747
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,827
(Woman) But there's no reason
that sex from behind

748
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,040
always has to have
the man in control.

749
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,994
Reverse cowgirl
lets the woman set the pace,

750
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,498
whilst allowing her easy access
to caress her own clitoris,

751
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:03,837
and gives the man a graphic view
that may well speed his climax.

752
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,065
(Man) At quite a wild end
of the scale can be standing sex,

753
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:23,690
which can have a desperate
"must-have-you-now" urgency to it.

754
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,534
This makes it a great option
for quickies.

755
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,279
Whether it's from behind
or facing each other,

756
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:34,451
standing-up sex can offer a needy,
urgent compulsion to the act.

757
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,921
(Woman) There are few sexier ways
to start an evening than with a quickie

758
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,965
once you're all dressed up
and ready for a night on the town

759
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,170
when you really should be
on your way.

760
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,644
(Man) And then there's anal sex.

761
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:57,975
Anal sex has gone from being a taboo
act that men begged their partners to try,

762
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,518
to becoming increasingly popular.

763
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,110
Of course, good anal sex,

764
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,905
meaning anal sex that
is pleasurable and painless,

765
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,990
is not something
that happens overnight.

766
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:12,114
It can take weeks or even months
for a partner to open up and relax.

767
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,549
(Woman) Regardless of position,

768
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,261
ultimate sex is all about finding out
what works for both of you.

769
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,046
Don't be afraid to experiment,

770
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:33,351
and accept that making mistakes
and even laughing at various faux pas

771
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,599
are all part of the process.

772
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:40,438
Half the fun of learning about sex
together is the practice.

773
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,413
(Man) Sexual exploration
can be very exciting,

774
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,462
even without topping things off
with an orgasm.

775
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:10,054
But most people consider having
the big '0' as a solid finale to sex.

776
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,674
(Woman) Of course,
making that happen for both partners

777
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,891
can be more difficult than it sounds.

778
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:20,814
Women who require more foreplay
and greater stimulation during sex

779
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,100
generally have more trouble
reaching climax,

780
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,899
particularly via intercourse.

781
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,459
(Man) An erection is
psycho-physiological magic

782
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:51,087
and can't always be relied on
to spring up on demand.

783
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:54,432
This is when the woman
should not blame him or herself,

784
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,134
but take charge.

785
00:55:56,228 --> 00:56:01,064
Kissing, caressing and talking sexily
can all help him firm things up.

786
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:05,059
Or you can use your mouth
more directly to spur things on.

787
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,489
And, rather than panicking,

788
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,908
the man should think sexy thoughts,

789
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,495
perhaps using the fantasies that
he revels in when he is alone.

790
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,662
And he should remember there are
multiple ways to satisfy his lover

791
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,244
even if his penis won't play.

792
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,003
(Woman) Accept this as a part
of normal lovemaking,

793
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,174
and an opportunity
for more oral pleasuring.

794
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:35,765
Stroking the perineum
or stimulating the prostate gland

795
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:40,433
if he's into that, can also bring things
back on track in record time.

796
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,770
(Man) If it's a condom related issue,

797
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:54,200
then masturbating while wearing one
will help him get used to the sensation.

798
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,779
Not having safe sex, though,
should not be an option,

799
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,414
especially early in a relationship.

800
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,580
Yet, however much effort
it takes to get there,

801
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,466
the result should be
wonderfully worth it.

802
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:22,308
(Woman) Female arousal is linked less
to direct sensory output from the genitals

803
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,436
and more to relaxation
and lack of anxiety.

804
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:35,191
Scans show that female orgasm
produces activity

805
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,823
across all brain regions
that handle emotion.

806
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:42,452
Letting go of fear and anxiety
greatly increases the chance

807
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,541
of reaching orgasm.

808
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,501
Females need to take charge
of their own pleasure.

809
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,292
Don't be dependent
on how good a lover he is,

810
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:55,504
it's not his responsibility
to give you an orgasm -

811
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:58,430
you have to reach one for yourself.

812
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:02,643
(Man) But a man can help enormously
by giving a woman time.

813
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,934
Engage in at least 20 minutes
of foreplay.

814
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,267
As the American sex researcher,
Alfred Kinsey, showed,

815
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:14,147
over 90% of women will reach
their orgasm after this amount of time.

816
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:17,029
(Woman) Link that with going
for your orgasm first,

817
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,620
get him to help you reach one
with his hands, tongue or a vibrator.

818
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:25,829
(Man) The "lady-comes-first" rule
takes the pressure off both of you.

819
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:33,048
(Woman) The two Fs
for a more guaranteed orgasm are:

820
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,627
Friction and Fantasy.

821
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:38,466
You have a magic button
that he doesn't have.

822
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,094
The majority of women,
when they masturbate,

823
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:44,059
take between three and six minutes
to climax,

824
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:47,980
but it can take over 20 minutes with
their partner in penetrative intercourse,

825
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,266
if it happens at all.

826
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,195
(Man) The second F is fantasize
while you're having sex.

827
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,899
Let your imagination go wild.

828
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:02,278
The joy of fantasy is that
there are no rules or regulations.

829
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:05,498
Bring in some of the thoughts you have
while you masturbate,

830
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:08,326
let yourself visualize intensely.

831
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,419
Your brain is the most powerful
sex organ,

832
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,544
use it to help you reach your climax.

833
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,629
(Woman) During orgasm,
the skin becomes more sensitive,

834
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,673
the body requires more oxygen
which speeds breathing,

835
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:26,060
blood pressure rises,
creating a pink flush in the cheeks,

836
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:29,647
and the genitals pulse
as the muscles contract.

837
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,229
The genital region harbours
a multitude of different nerves.

838
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,436
The penis has a total of 6,000,

839
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,314
but the clitoris has 8,000 nerves.

840
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,489
The orgasmic sensation varies
depending on the area touched.

841
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,742
(Man) Some say a man's orgasm
differs from a woman's

842
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,460
or that a vaginal orgasm
differs from a clitoral one

843
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,372
because different sets
of nerves are involved.

844
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:58,843
The nerve that gives the orgasmic
feeling sends messages to the brain,

845
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,878
bypassing the spinal column

846
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:06,597
which is what allows some paraplegic
people to still feel sexual sensation.

847
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:10,054
A collection of neurons
called the nucleus accumbens,

848
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,731
or colloquially
"the brain's pleasure center",

849
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:17,065
becomes highly active
as a woman's orgasm approaches.

850
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,866
(Woman) The part of the brain
responsible for reward and empathy

851
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,651
goes into high-alert mode,

852
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,579
as does the one producing
the hormone oxytocin,

853
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,118
the bonding chemical.

854
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,869
(Man) And so orgasm happens,

855
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:38,215
and it seems to last significantly longer
in women than in men.

856
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,890
(Woman) When it comes to climaxing,
every couple is different.

857
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,643
You might enjoy mutual orgasms
quite often,

858
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,109
you may work each other up to a state
of near-climax with words alone,

859
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,938
or it could take all night
and hours of foreplay.

860
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,159
(Man) One or both of you may find it
hard to climax from sex alone

861
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:10,123
and need to reach conclusion with
the help of fingers, tongues or toys.

862
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:14,786
There is no right or wrong,
only what makes you both feel good.

863
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:19,085
And that's something you can
only discover together.

864
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:41,605
Although the penis and the vagina
usually get all the attention,

865
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:47,827
the truth is that your mouth is the most
important part of any sexual relationship.

866
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,742
And not just for kissing and oral sex.

867
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,291
Using it for communication or sharing
is the big key

868
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,994
towards getting your needs met.

869
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,963
(Woman) As relationships deepen,
desires change.

870
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:06,049
People evolve and issues arise.

871
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:09,716
With open communication,
lovers can effectively address

872
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,513
all the twists and turns
of a sexual partnership

873
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:16,105
and grow together
rather than drift apart.

874
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,529
(Man) It is possible to go
through all the motions of sex

875
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:27,650
without allowing your emotions
to get too involved.

876
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:32,830
But surely the best sex is the kind
that deepens intimacy and involvement.

877
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,997
Being honest about everything,
from your erotic fantasies

878
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,085
to your life-long insecurities,

879
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:43,549
builds the kind of rapport that
a quick one-nighter could never match.

880
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,130
(Woman) Even in the early stages
of a relationship,

881
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,506
honesty will help you develop
a healthy, loving bond.

882
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,887
(Man) And when things
don't go as planned,

883
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:56,812
or there's a droopy erection
or a just-out-reach orgasm,

884
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:00,232
it's talking about it that's going
to help you survive the awkwardness

885
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,855
and resolve the problem.

886
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:09,491
(Woman) A healthy sex life helps
produce a healthy psychological state.

887
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,114
Beyond the joys of having
first-rate orgasms,

888
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,451
the hormones that
get released during sex

889
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,248
foster a sense of well-being

890
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:21,371
and an increased desire to bond with
the person lying next to you in bed.

891
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,089
(Man) Sex offers the chance
to become

892
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:32,298
sexually, emotionally
and spiritually fulfilled,

893
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,599
and sharing intimacy with another

894
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:38,554
actually allows us
to better understand ourselves.

895
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,442
(Woman) For many people
leading busy lives,

896
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,778
enriching their sex lives
might just mean

897
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,772
setting aside a few hours
with their partner

898
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,899
after the kids have gone to sleep,

899
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:54,953
climbing into bed early
and rekindling neglected desires.

900
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:03,495
(Man) As if the pleasures
of experiencing powerful orgasms

901
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,958
and a lover's blissful cries
weren't enough,

902
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:11,508
good sex might actually help you
prolong your life

903
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,010
and that of the person you love.

904
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,688
(Woman) With an incentive like that,
why would anyone resist the allure

905
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:31,573
of igniting desire and striving
for the greatest sex of their lives?
